# Distributed and Parallel Image Processing

**User Guide**

In order to be able to run the API, it is necessary to install Gin. It is a HTTP web framework, which helps to build applications and microservices in Go (Golang). To install Gin run in a terminal the following command:

	$ go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin

  

Once Gin is installed, the server needs to be available. For running the server use the next command:

  

	$ go run ./main.go

  

After running the server in a different terminal client requests may be sent. One of them is access providing username, password and port to be use:

	$ curl -u username:password http://localhost:8080/login
Receiving a similar JSON message with a access token:

>"message": "Hi username, welcome to the DPIP System",

>"token" "OjIE89GzFw"

 
Other client request is status adding the access token given previously:

	$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" http://localhost:8080/status

Receiving JSON message with exact time and date:
>"message": "Hi username, the DPIP System is Up and Running"

>"time": "2015-03-07 11:06:39"

The third possible client request is upload, which allows the client to open a local file using the file path and the access token:

  

	$ curl -F 'data=@/path/to/local/image.png' -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" http://localhost:8080/upload

  

Receiving JSON message with the file name and size:

 

>"message": "An image has been successfully uploaded",

>"filename": "image.png",

>"size": "500kb"

  
  

Finally the last cliente request is logout using the access token:

	$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" http://localhost:8080/logout

Receiving JSON message with the following:

>"message": "Bye username, your token has been revoked"
